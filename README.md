STREAMY

This is a web app created with react and redux, that can be used for creating streams. Users can login and logout using Google Auth; create channels (streams), view ongoing streams, edit their personal streams, and delete streams.

The homepage shows the list of available streams, and even though users can view those streams without logging in, they cannot create or edit streams.
